      <!-- Your bio page is a place for people to get to know you. You should include your interests, things you are good at, and in general you should pull back enough of the curtain into your life to interest a potential employer in you as a person. -->

        <h3>A bit about me</h3>
        <p>I'm a fun-loving fella who's keen to explore the outdoors and the boundaries that present themselves.</p>
        <p>A photographer at heart, I enjoy taking pictures of wildlife, landscapes, and space subjects. <a class="noUnderline" href="pics.html">Here are a few I've taken with my phone.</a></p>
        <p>Unsurprisingly as a software dev, I also love gaming. My favourite games at the moment are <a class="noUnderline" href="https://www.bungie.net/7/en/destiny">Destiny 2</a> and <a class="noUnderline" href="https://www.rocketleague.com/en">Rocket League</a> &#40love-hate relationship with RL&#41.</p>
